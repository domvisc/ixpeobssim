# Contributing to ixpeobssim 

There are many ways you can contribute ixpeobssim:  

* contributing documentation, in the form of python doc, sphinx source files, as well as documents like this;
* using ixpeobssim and reporting bugs, suggestions and patches into the [issue tracker](https://github.com/lucabaldini/ixpeobssim/issues);
* following up on current issues by posting comments in the issue tracker and/or submitting pull requests.

We are always looking for new core developers to add to our small group, and, if you are particularly motivated, this is
definitely a possibility!


# Quick overview

The basic process for contributing patches to either the source code or the documentation is pretty standard:

1. create an account on [githib](https://github.com), if you don't have one already;
2. fork the ixpeobssim [repository](https://github.com/lucabaldini/ixpeobssim);
3. clone the fork to a local working copy on our own machine

```
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR ID HERE>/ixpeobssim
```

4. create a development branche in our own working copy, e.g.

```
git branch my_own_branch
git checkout my_own_branch
```
 
5. do you own things---hopefully for the best;
6. commit the changes to your fork

```
git commit -a -m "see what I did?"
```

7. push the new stuff to your fork; 

```
git push
```

8. GO to github and submit a pull request from the forked branch into the main ixpeobssim repo.

Someone of the other hand will pick things up from there...
